# ruby-cli-template

Hello everyone! I'm Reza, the creator of Reza's Shop :) Without wasting anymore time, I'd love to explain what this app does.
You'll first run "ruby client.rb" in your terminal. On the screen, you'll notice that you've "entered" the shop.
The prompt will ask you for your name, which you will then input. You'll officially be registered as a customer of the shop, congrats!
You'll now notice a variety of different options to select from along with a budget amount at the top of the screen.
The budget amount represents how much money you'll be able to spend while your "browsing" the shop.
If you for whatever reason would like to reset this amount after purchasing some items just make sure to exit the app and then rerun it.
As far as the options, they're fairly straightforward.
